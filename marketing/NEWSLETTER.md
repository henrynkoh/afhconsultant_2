**Preheader**: This week's focus: Understanding ramp ratios and water temperature requirements

---

**Body**

Hi [First Name],

Ready for this week's study focus? Let's dive into **Physical Plant Requirements** from Module 1.

**This Week's Key Topics:**

1. **Ramp Logic (1:12 Ratio)**
   - For every 1 inch of vertical rise, you need 12 inches of horizontal length
   - Must have 3x3 ft landings at top and bottom
   - Handrails required on both sides

2. **Water Temperature Safety**
   - Must be between 105°F and 120°F
   - Too hot = burns, Too cold = hygiene issues
   - Test at all resident-accessible taps

3. **Bedroom Square Footage**
   - 80 sq ft for single occupancy
   - 120 sq ft for double occupancy
   - Closets DON'T count toward usable space

**Practice Questions:**
- [Link to Module 1 Questions]
- Filter by "Physical Plant & Safety"
- Try answering before revealing answers

**Study Challenge:**
Can you explain the 1:12 ramp ratio to someone else? Teaching reinforces learning!

**Next Week**: We'll focus on Emergency Planning and the 72-hour supply requirement.

Keep up the great work!

Best,
AFH Compliance Architect Team

1. **Systematic Study**: "I completed one module per week, studying 1-2 hours daily."

2. **Practice Questions**: "The 250 questions were invaluable. I answered each one multiple times until I understood the logic."

3. **R.A.R. Method**: "Learning to think like a consultant using the R.A.R. method was a game-changer. It helped me on the exam and in real consulting."

**Results:**

✅ Passed certification on first attempt
✅ Now consulting with 5 AFH providers
✅ Zero-deficiency inspection rate: 100%

**Sarah's Advice:**

"Don't just memorize answers. Understand the 'why' behind each regulation. That's what makes you a great consultant."
