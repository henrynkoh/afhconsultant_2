```
🧵 THREAD: 5 Things Every AFH Consultant Should Know

1/6 Physical Plant Requirements
The 1:12 ramp ratio isn't just a number - it's about ensuring residents with mobility devices can safely access the home. Every inch matters when it comes to compliance.

2/6 Water Temperature Safety
Hot water must be between 105°F-120°F. Too hot = burns. Too cold = hygiene issues. This is one of the most common deficiencies.

3/6 Emergency Evacuation
All residents must reach safety in 5 minutes or less. This requires regular drills, clear pathways, and trained staff. Practice makes perfect.

4/6 Medication Documentation
The MAR (Medication Administration Record) is your legal document. Every entry matters. No white-out. No erasures. Only clear, accurate documentation.

5/6 Resident-Centered Care
It's not just about compliance - it's about dignity. Meals, activities, and care must reflect resident preferences and cultural backgrounds.

6/6 Want to master all of this? Our platform has 5 modules and 250+ questions to prepare you. Link in bio.

What's your biggest compliance challenge? 👇
