<h2>Why AFH Compliance Training Matters</h2>
<p>Washington State's Adult Family Home regulations (WAC 388-76) are extensive and constantly evolving. Consultants need deep, practical knowledge to help providers succeed. Without proper training, consultants risk providing incomplete guidance, leading to failed inspections.</p>

<li><strong>MAR Documentation</strong> - Reading and filling out Medication Administration Records</li>
<li><strong>Nutrition & Activities</strong> - Food services, meal planning, recreational activity requirements</li>
</ul>

<h3>250+ Practice Questions</h3>
<p>Each module includes 50 logic-based practice questions with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed answers</li>
<li>WAC citation references</li>

<h2>The R.A.R. Method</h2>
<p>Every effective consultant uses the R.A.R. Method:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>R - Regulation (WAC):</strong> What does the code literally say?</li>
<li><strong>A - Assessment (Risk):</strong> What is the danger to a vulnerable adult?</li>
<li><strong>R - Remedy (Physical):</strong> What exact tool or measurement fixes it?</li>
</ul>
<p>This platform teaches you to apply this method to every compliance question.</p>
